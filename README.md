    Preamble
    This is the online repository for the DevOps Assignment.

Each team should fill in the blanks <<>> and add additional content that the team agrees on. This is your contract of work. It is an agreement amongst yourselves. Honour it.



The end customer would like an online booking system for range of Movie making courses. Their most
popular product this December is Moving Castle Creations – a 3D animation workshop. The system
must take details of customer map them to the course modules along with a single box for extra ‘nice
to have’ requests. The system should be clean and simple. Your team has been tasked with creating
the pipeline for the SDLC. You have also been asked to provide a simple prototype page(s) to test the
pipeline. The system needsto take into account the usual security requirements. The administrator of
the end system (Studio Ghibli member) should be able to access detailed information and edit as
appropriate. Once the client enters details it should not be able to be changed by the person applying
for the course.

Our product will be delivered using an Agile methodology that embraces the DevOps culture. Please note that our culture embraces change and these documents are treated as living, breathing artefacts that will be continuously updated.  The scrum master and product owner will be assigned in a rotation basis per each sprint.
